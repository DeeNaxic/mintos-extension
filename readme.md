##### Introduction

This project aims to add a layer of information and functionality to the Mintos P2P investment website, through a Chrome Extension. The project is driven by a group of computer scientists from the Copenhagen University of Computer Science (DIKU), who likes to work with investments. The extension was originally an internal tool we used, to fix visual and information gaps on the Mintos website, to improve our experience. From here it has grown and has now been released to the public. Some key points about the extension are:

##### Transparency

This GitHub repository is intended for our Chrome Extension (see link for Chrome Store page) release packages, the source code from which they are compiled and a collection of features, bugs, and tasks currently in development. The repository is not intended for public use by default, but it does also serve as a way to provide an additional layer of transparency. Trust is an important aspect when it comes to investments, and we do encourage people to perform a full audit of our source code, or even download and run the unpacked extension locally. If you do not have the technical experience to perform such an audit, but still want to ensure that what you are running is not malicious, then feel free to send the repository to someone who does. The code is written in standard JavaScript with a small amount of CSS and HTML, and as so should be fairly trivial to understand. The following are important aspects in regards to trust:

- The extension does not monetize in any way, it is entirely free.
- The extension does not automate or perform any action for you.
- The extension does not falsely alter any information displayed on the website.
- The extension does not store or send any information about you or your investments.
- The extension does not require any login or user information.
