Dear Mintos.com users,

We are currently developing a chrome extension for use on the Mintos.com website, and are looking for a few beta testers (any regular people using the website), to help us test the extension, and help guide our future development path. First some basics:

The extension does not:
- Log, store or send any information anywhere.
- Automate any actions for you.
- Monetizes in any way, no ads, premium or hidden costs.
- Prevent or alter the actions you have on the website.
- require any login, user information or personal information

The extension does:
- Add additional information to various pages.
- Change cosmetic aspects of the website.
- Allow for features to be turned on or off individually.
- Run directly in your browser with minimal setup required.
- Provide a full open-source code for full transparency.



The purpose of the extension is to add a rich set of additional features and cosmetic changes, to the Mintos website, in order to present more information and help you do things faster. The extension runs in Chrome only, and runs a post-processing code, when you visit Minto's sites, so everything that the extension does, is entirely in your browser, and it will never communicate with any server or external site. For full disclosure, and to state it clearly: This extension is not an official Mintos.com product, but they are aware and acceptant of it. You can enable or disable the individual features from the settings panel. While the list of available features grow as we get suggestions, here are some of the current features, see the attached screenshots for more details.

Overview page:
- Hide unused (zero) information.
- Highlight the negative numbers in red.
- Show a percentage column as well.
- Switch the radio buttons to a regular button (cosmetic).

Finished investments page:
- Add a column for the country.
- Make loan type column into filtering links for.
- Show a column for the duration a note was held in days.
- Show a column for the profit made over this duration.

Loan details page:
- Add the country as information.
- Show a percentage of payments made on time.
- Properly format the investment breakdown table (cosmetic).
- Adds additional information about the loan provider and their terms.
- Highlight important information e.g. non-current status, upcoming terms, etc.



In order to participate in the closed beta, please send an e-mail to: investment.extensions@gmail.com and please include a little information about:
- Your technical competence.
- How frequent you visit the Mintos.com (regardless of what you do there).
- What you expect from the extension.
