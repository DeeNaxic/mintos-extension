# Investment Extensions: www.Mintos.com

##### **1. Introduction**
This github repository is meant as a collection for our Chrome Extension release packages, the sourcecode from which it is compiled, and the documentation and letters which we have sent out through different media. This page is not intented as public use by default, but instead as a way to provide an additional layer of transparency. Trust is very important when it comes to investments, and you are more than welcome to do a full audit of our sourcecode, and even download and run it as an unpacked extension locally. If you do not have enough technical experience yourself, please feel free to send the repository link to someone who does, who you trust, if you want the code validated for security reasons. If you have any question about the content, suggestions, or simply want to improve the way we do things, please do hit us up on an e-mail at investment.extensions@gmail.com
